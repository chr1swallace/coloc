\title{Bayesian colocalisation analysis with detailed output}
\usage{
coloc.detail(
  dataset1,
  dataset2,
  MAF = NULL,
  p1 = 1e-04,
  p2 = 1e-04,
  p12 = 1e-05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset1}{a list with the following elements
\describe{

\item{pvalues}{P-values for each SNP in dataset 1}

\item{N}{Number of samples in dataset 1}

\item{MAF}{minor allele frequency of the variants}

\item{zs}{z-score of association for each SNP in dataset 1}

\item{beta}{regression coefficient for each SNP from dataset 1}

\item{varbeta}{variance of beta}

\item{type}{the type of data in dataset 1 - either "quant" or "cc" to denote quantitative or case-control}

\item{s}{for a case control dataset, the proportion of samples in dataset 1 that are cases}

\item{sdY}{for a quantitative trait, the population standard deviation of the trait.  if not given, it can be estimated from the vectors of varbeta and MAF}

\item{snp}{a character vector of snp ids, optional. If present, it will be used to merge dataset1 and dataset2.  Otherwise, the function assumes dataset1 and dataset2 contain results for the same SNPs in the same order.}

}

Some of these items may be missing, but you must give
\itemize{
\item{always}{\code{type}}
\item{if \code{type}=="cc"}{\code{s}, \code{N}}
\item{if \code{type}=="quant" and \code{sdY} known}{\code{sdY}}
\item{if \code{type}=="quant" and \code{sdY} unknown}{\code{beta}, \code{varbeta}, \code{N}, \code{MAF}}
and then either
\item{}{\code{pvalues}, \code{MAF}}
\item{}{\code{zs}, \code{MAF}}
\item{}{\code{beta}, \code{varbeta}}
}}

\item{dataset2}{as above, for dataset 2}

\item{MAF}{Common minor allele frequency vector to be used for both dataset1 and dataset2, a shorthand for supplying the same vector as parts of both datasets}

\item{p1}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 1, default 1e-4}

\item{p2}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 2, default 1e-4}

\item{p12}{prior probability a SNP is associated with both traits, default 1e-5}
}
\value{
a list of three \code{data.tables}s:
\itemize{
\item summary is a vector giving the number of SNPs analysed, and the posterior probabilities of H0 (no causal variant), H1 (causal variant for trait 1 only), H2 (causal variant for trait 2 only), H3 (two distinct causal variants) and H4 (one common causal variant)
\item df is an annotated version of the input data containing log Approximate Bayes Factors and intermediate calculations, and the posterior probability SNP.PP.H4 of the SNP being causal for the shared signal
\item df3 is the same for all 2 SNP H3 models
}
