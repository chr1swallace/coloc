	* v3.2 added colocqq for quantitative traits measured on the same individuals

	fix bug in process.datasets which suggested MAF was needed for cc
	data when beta/varbeta also present

	added pkgdown

2018-02-22    <chris@froome>

	* v3.1 improved clarity of error messages in coloc.abf() sub functions
	added finemap.abf to fine map a single trait
	fixed warnings caused by CRAN disliking the BioConductor devel branch

2017-03-21 Chris Wallace <cew54@cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.4 added stratification to proportional testing approaches

2013-05-22 Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.3-2 Tidied code relating mainly to proportional
	colocalisation testing methods, making more methods confirm to S4.

	pcs.prepare now imputates missing genotypes by default

2013-09-25  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.3
	BUGFIX: Introduced a function to estimate trait variance
	from supplied coefficients and standard errors.  This is used
	within the approach implemented in coloc.abf(), and replaces the
	earlier version which implicity assumed that var(Y)=1 for
	quantitative traits, which could lead to incorrect inference when
	var(Y) was far from 1.

2013-19-06  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.2
	Merged coloc.abf and coloc.abf.imputed(), so that datasets for
	wheich beta, var(beta) are available can be matched to datasets
	with only p values and maf.2

	This means the arguments to coloc.abf() have been changed!  Please
	check ?coloc.abf for the new function.

2013-03-06  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.1
	Bug fix for coloc.abf() function, which used p12 instead of
	log(p12) to calculate L4.

	New function coloc.abf.imputed() to make better use of fuller
	information on imputed data.

2013-22-05  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v2.0
	New function, coloc.abf(), to implement the colocalisation
	approach described by Giambartolomei et. al.

	Changes in the coloc.test() and coloc.bma() functions to make them
	consistent with regards arguments and output.

2012-12-10  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.11
	added principal components functions pcs.prepare(), pcs.model().
	Restructed the coloc objects to separate Bayesian and non-Bayesian inference.

2012-11-28  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.10
	added Credible Interval calculation to coloc.test().

2012-07-12  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.09
	updated to return u and Var(u) in addition to chisq statistic.

2012-04-12  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.08
	fixed error in documentation, added MASS to Depends.

2012-01-05  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.06
	some tidying.

2012-01-03  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.05
	moved to S4 methods.

2011-12-27  Chris Wallace  <chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk>

	* v1.04
	made the means of generating plots more flexible.
